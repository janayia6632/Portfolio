    <h1>Reflection Day 6</h1>
    <p>Today I learned the basics in making a sprite move on python. I figured out a pattern similar to what you can use on scratch to figure out how to draw shapes</p>
    <h1>Reflection Day 7</h1>
    <p>Today I learned how to create functions and nested conditionals on python. Nested conditionals allow you to have multiple if else statements within a function allowing you to not have to make a bunch of if statements.</p>
    <h1>Reflection Day 8</h1>
    <p>Today I learned how to properly use a loop. I wasn't completely sure of how to use them but know I have a more solid understanding. I also learned how to pixelate a image and give different colors to the pixels instead of just presenting the image. I'm not really sure which groups work really well together. I didn't really pay that much attention to the groups we were put in.</p>
      <h1>Reflection Day 9</1h>
      <p>Today we built a roulette game. The hard part wasn't coding the game, the hard part was trying to accurately putting in the rules of the game. Another issue was I keep forgetting to put either a colon or some ending punctuation.</p>
      <h1>Reflection Day</h1>
      <p>Today we made LED lights glow alternately and we used a photosensor to make the LED turn on and off depending on how much light there is. I was a lot better at understanding the code then building the circuit.</p>
